              Ravoeira is a sequence of historical records; of an entirely
              subjective analysis of a fictional character, who lived over
              centuries facing oppression. She was subjected to brutal violence
              and were deprived from her right to operate her body. The traveler
              ravoeira has nonetheless created her own weapons of resistance;
              such resistance that were emancipative against instruments of
              orchestrated corruption of power.

              Ravoeira is an artistic performance executed with a set of digital
              and mechanical structures, which are choreographed to serve an
              expressiveness of an ages old pseudo character.
            </p>
            <p>
              This character is initially a slave on her way to americas from
              africa. From the rhythmic tunes of desert sounds and drums the
              travel is simulated through gnawa trance music and experienced in
              its sense of choreography, which is also a dance and healing
              practice as a form of physical exercise. A rhythm workshop and a
              simulated ship ride to brazil during the early phases of
              industrialism follows the travel that is made by force as part of
              the early industrialist, transatlantic slave trade.{' '}

              Through the suffering and solidarity, ravoeira is the least
              commodified human with no real possession other than that of the
              body, and a set of bodies in space. Yet she herself is a
              possession of varying power structures that span over privileged
              characters narrated by varying roles.{' '}
            </p>

            <p>
              Ravoeira tries to pervert an attempt to make a fictional story
              about the birth of capoeira, by which means it tries to address
              the metaphysical norms such as play & fight, kill & love, share &
              behold, collapse & expand, trigger & seclude... It is a discourse
              by a human being whose suffering brought about, beyond-all, an
              artistic practice. Via this discourse, dichotomies are aimed to
              dissolve into additive intensities disregarding any standard
              measure of “success” and “failure”.
            </p>
            <p>
              Ravoeira questions the set of power structures that had existed
              throughout ages and how they have instrumented, orchestrated,
              accumulated, distributed and abused the power that were beheld for
              and against the organisms in its territory. Ravoeira is an attempt
              at comprehending the status quo in this troll-dominated political
              spectrum of thought and accordingly how a potential
              post-capitalist power structure could be foreseen, yet instigated.
              Ravoeira articulates different notions of difference such as
              gender, color, economic class, upbringing, citizenship and
              labour-occupations; and how they interrelate to each other as to
              comprehend the fluidity of privilege within and across those who
              accumulate and distribute it.

              Within Ravoeira the protagonist who does have a name but not a
              fixed one; shares her story of her resistance. A story that is,
              perhaps, otherwise never shared.
