## Spiral Sphinx

#### a framework for movement improvisations

_workshop_

## Concept

Inspired primarily from Capoeira and its historical evolution, but also infinitesimals theory in mathematics, and some other improvisation techniques such as _Axis Syllabus_ (Frey Faust), _Movement Archery_ (Tom Weksler) and _Continously into Movement_ (Eva Georgitsopoulou); Spiral Sphinx is a framework for movement improvisations. Pursued as a workshop that continue with certain instructions and exercises given to its participants, it is practiced with a set of special methods, related to geometry and mathematics of the body.

Within Spiral Sphinx, participants explore the boundaries that they often consent to move within during daily quotidian movements - such as actively or passively being choreographed by interior settings and furniture at any given space. They are expected to become aware and re-articulate default choreography executed by modernist-industrialist axiom that recur in varying forms, guided by a serious of instructions of collapse and expand. Then the process continues by trying to create new algebraic formulations that lead us to move in unprecedented rhythms as opposed to movements that occur within such determinate external barriers.

Seeing body as a radically autonomous assemblage and everything it does as an impact of an algebraically complex algorithm, one could be curious to see how a set of simple & complex algebraic movement codes can regenerate endless possibilities of complex curves in movement. In Spiral Sphinx, movements are not externally predefined by a space limiting an organism that it contains. In contrast, the organism is to redefine the space by its movement patterns via oscillating rhythms.
