# infinitesimals Â» space

Infinitesimals are infinitely small numbers, objects in nature, that are so incalculably small. Therefore they are _assumed_ to be non-existent in [Standard Analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_analysis), despite that they are [_admitted_](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/continuity/) to exist.

Here in this website, you will find documentation of artworks, ideas, software, and other processes by **Emin Durak**.
